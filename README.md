## Improvements to be made
Code refactoring: This was my first time using React. I learnt it within two days, and as such, it is messy.  
Extra information: I had hoped to add bubbles on screen which could be clicked. These would then expand and contain more detailed information and images (such as of the samples Perseverance has collected).  
UI: The user interface looks like it was built in the early 2000s. It is at hackathons such as this that I'm suddenly reminded why I don't make user interfaces.  
And much more...
